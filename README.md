# Wealth-Calculators
Hi,
I'm Daniel. 
As an exercise to use what I have learned about Python coding, I decided to make simple calculators that can be used for creating wealth. My first attempts were made with PYSimple GUI and after having several such modules, I can use them as parts of some bigger software which does various predictions and shows principles how to accumulate wealth more effectively. They are simple pieces of coding work, result of six month of my part time study of Python.
